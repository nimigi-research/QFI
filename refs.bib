% refs.bib — updated to cover new citations used in the improved QFI text.
% Notes:
%   • Added: Billingsley, Durrett, Meyn–Tweedie, and a Time‑Varying Graphs survey (TVGSurvey).
%   • Included a compatibility alias key `Chung1977` (same book as Chung1997) to avoid missing keys.
%   • Left Seneta (1993) with a TODO note, as in your prior file.
